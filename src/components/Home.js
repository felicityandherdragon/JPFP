      <div id='home-slider'>
        <h2>Welcome home!</h2>
        <p>Best resolution: <b>1200 - 1400px</b> <br /> AKA "I did not manage to fix styling issues when screens get bigger or smaller"</p>
        <img src='../../public/images/S4_Artboard Copy 6.jpg' />
        <p>I added the homepage but then didn't know what extra stuff i can add here.
        So here is one single random image for the homepage.</p>
      </div>
